## Why Choose Astro?

Astro offers several advantages for building blogs:

- **Performance:** Ships zero JavaScript by default.
- **Flexibility:** Supports multiple frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.).
- **Content-first:** Markdown and MDX support out of the box.
- **SEO-friendly:** Generates static HTML for every page.

> **Note:** Astro is framework-agnostic, so you can use your favorite UI libraries or none at all.

## Getting Started

Let's begin by creating a new Astro project.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Create a New Project

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

You'll be prompted to choose a template. For a blog, select the `blog` template or start with the `minimal` template for more control.

### Install Dependencies

Navigate into your project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd my-astro-blog
npm install
```

### Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) to see your site in action.

## Project Structure

Astro projects have a simple, intuitive structure:

my-astro-blog/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ content/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â””â”€â”€ package.json

- **public/**: Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
- **src/pages/**: Route-based pages (e.g., `index.astro`, `about.astro`)
- **src/content/**: Markdown or MDX blog posts (if using content collections)
- **src/components/**: Reusable UI components
- **src/layouts/**: Layout components for consistent page structure


## Creating Blog Posts

Astro supports Markdown and MDX for content. Let's create a simple blog post.

### 1. Add a Markdown File

Create a new file in `src/content/blog/` (you may need to create these folders):

```
src/content/blog/hello-world.md
```

Add the following content:

````markdown
---
title: "Hello World"
pubDate: 2025-05-16
description: "My first Astro blog post."
author: "Jane Doe"
tags: ["astro", "blog"]

## Why Choose Astro?

Astro stands out among static site generators for several reasons:

- **Zero JavaScript by Default:** Astro only sends the JavaScript you need, making your site lightning fast.
- **Component Agnostic:** Use React, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML components together.
- **Markdown-First:** Write your content in Markdown, and Astro handles the rest.
- **Built-in Image Optimization:** Astro optimizes images out of the box.
- **Easy Deployment:** Deploy to any static hosting provider with minimal configuration.


## Setting Up Your Astro Project

Let's start by creating a new Astro project.

### 1. Install Node.js

Astro requires Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher). You can check your version with:

```bash
node -v
```
````

If you need to install or update Node.js, visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Create a New Astro Project

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

You'll be prompted to name your project and select a template. For a blog, you can choose the "Blog" template or start with the "Minimal" template.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Navigate into your project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd your-project-name
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:4321` in your browser to see your new Astro site!


## Creating Blog Pages

Astro uses a file-based routing system. To create a new page, simply add a `.astro` file to the `src/pages` directory.

For example, to create an "About" page:

```bash
touch src/pages/about.astro
```

Add the following content:

```astro
---
title: "About"
---
<h1>About This Blog</h1>
<p>Welcome to my Astro-powered blog!</p>
```


## Adding Markdown Support

Astro makes it easy to write blog posts in Markdown. By default, Markdown files placed in `src/pages` become pages on your site.

### 1. Create a Blog Post

Create a new file:

```bash
mkdir -p src/pages/posts
touch src/pages/posts/hello-world.md
```

Add the following content:

```markdown
---
title: "Hello World"
pubDate: 2024-06-01
description: "My first post with Astro!"
author: "Dominik"
---

# Hello World

Welcome to my first blog post using Astro! ðŸš€

Astro makes it easy to write content in Markdown and publish it as a fast, modern website.
```

### 2. Frontmatter

The section at the top (between `---`) is called "frontmatter." It lets you define metadata for your post, such as the title, date, and description.


## Listing Blog Posts

To display a list of your blog posts, you can use Astro's `glob` import to fetch all Markdown files in a directory.

Create a new file at `src/pages/blog.astro`:

```astro
---
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';

const posts = await getCollection('posts');
---

<h1>Blog</h1>
<ul>
  {posts.map(post => (
    <li>
      <a href={post.url}>{post.data.title}</a> - <small>{post.data.pubDate}</small>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

> **Note:** If you want to use `getCollection`, you need to set up [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/). For a simple blog, you can use `import.meta.glob`:

```astro
---
const postImporters = import.meta.glob('./posts/*.md');
const postPromises = Object.entries(postImporters).map(async ([path, resolver]) => {
  const post = await resolver();
  return {
    url: path.replace('./', '/').replace('.md', ''),
    ...post.frontmatter,
  };
});
const posts = await Promise.all(postPromises);
---

<h1>Blog</h1>
<ul>
  {posts.map(post => (
    <li>
      <a href={post.url}>{post.title}</a> - <small>{post.pubDate}</small>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```


## Styling Your Blog

Astro supports several ways to add styles:

- **Global CSS:** Place a CSS file in `src/styles` and import it in your `src/layouts` or `src/pages`.
- **Scoped Styles:** Add a `<style>` tag to any `.astro` file.

Example of scoped styles:

```astro
---
title: "Styled Page"
---
<h1>Styled Page</h1>
<p>This page has custom styles!</p>

<style>
  h1 {
    color: #7c3aed;
    font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  }
  p {
    font-size: 1.2rem;
  }
</style>
```


## Deploying Your Blog

Once you're happy with your blog, it's time to share it with the world!

### 1. Build Your Site

Run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates a static site in the `dist/` directory.

### 2. Deploy to a Static Host

You can deploy your Astro site to platforms like:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

For example, to deploy to Netlify:

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Connect your repository to Netlify.
3. Set the build command to `npm run build` and the publish directory to `dist`.

Astro's [deployment guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) has detailed instructions for each platform.
